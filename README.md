Description
===========
This extension will keep the nickname field populated at all times. The nickname will default
to the first name, unless another value is supplied by the user. If an existing value for
the nickname is removed, the nickname will be reset to the first name.

Important
=========
Installing this extension will immediately populate the nickname for any contact
which doesn't already have one. Repeat: upon installation, this extension will
update most or all of the contact records in your database.

Use case
========
This extension was written to allow users to confidently use the nickname token
in email messages without having to worry about whether or not it is populated
or use complex logic to fall back to another greeting.
